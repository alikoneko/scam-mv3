# scam-mv3

**scam-mv3** (**soundcloud account manager manifest v3**) is a simple account switching extension for [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com). this is a simple fork designed to work with manifest v3. new accounts are automatically added every time you log in. you can find them under the username dropdown. 

just download the source code and run it as an unpacked extension. i may or may not publish it to the chrome and firefox web stores in the future.

the original version is [here](https://github.com/sad/scam).

__let me know of any bugs cuz i kind of lazily did this with chatgpt lol. i just didnt want one of my favorite extensions to stop working on my browser so yeah.__
